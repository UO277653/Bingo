	<h1>How to play the game</h1>
	<p>You have just introduced the ticket code. In order to start playing tap the 'Roll' button, and the first number will be drawn. After you do this the
	ticket is consumed and you cannot use it again. You can also check your account without consuming the ticket. When a number that you have is drawn, click on it
	on the card, and it will be marked, if you forget to do it and roll again you lose that number. If you mark 3 numbers in the same row you can claim the line and
	win a prize, be careful not to forget to claim it in the same roll you obtained it, because you will not be able to claim it afterwards. If you mark all the numbers
	of the card you have a bingo, and have to claim it tapping the 'Bingo' button to claim it. Again, if you roll again afterwards you lose the opportunity to claim it.
	
	There is a special number, and when you claim a line which contains it you can win a 20 euro voucher</p>
