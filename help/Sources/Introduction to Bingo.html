	<h1>Introduction to Bingo</h1>
	<p>Bingo is a classic game of chance in which you have a card with numbers, and there is a drum from which some numbers will fall one at a time. 
	If one of them is in your card you have to mark it. When you have a complete row marked you have to sing (claim) it, and if you get all three of them you have a bingo! </p>
