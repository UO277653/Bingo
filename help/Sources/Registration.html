	<h1>Registration</h1>
	<p>In case you have won a voucher you have to registrate to claim it. Introduce either your ID or your passport to identificate yourself, and your name and surname.
	
	If you already have created an account only the identifier is needed to update the balance of the account. If you prefer not to provide any data you can proceed without
	registration, but you will lose your voucher.</p>
